DM Play Flow
============

This document captures the intended end-to-end flows for running a session
using the DM tools. Use it when making changes that touch multiple pages.

Primary Flow: Preparing and Running a Session
---------------------------------------------

1. From the DM Hub:
   - Select or create a campaign.
   - Select or create a session.
   - Use quick links to open Notes Book, Session Planner, or Play.

2. In Session Planner:
   - Create or adjust scenes for the selected session.
   - Link beats, notes, encounters, and maps to those scenes.

3. In Notes Book:
   - Write campaign and session notes.
   - Mark content as DM-only or player-visible.
   - Link entities (NPCs, locations, encounters, maps, SRD monsters).

4. In Encounter Designer:
   - Build encounters for the session using SRD monsters and roster NPCs.
   - Link encounters back to scenes and notes.

5. In DM Play Screen:
   - Select current session and scene.
   - View and update beats as the session progresses.
   - View scene notes (DM and player previews).
   - Start and run encounters.
   - Open SRD reference and maps as needed.

Secondary Flows
---------------

- Jumping from a note’s entity chip to the appropriate DM tool (roster,
  encounters, maps) and back.
- Deleting sessions/arcs/campaigns and verifying that linked notes, scenes,
  encounters, and beats are handled according to the selected cascade options.

As the implementation evolves, update this document with concrete navigation
paths (file names/routes) and any caveats in the flow.
